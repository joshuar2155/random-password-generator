# <random-password-generator>

## Description

This project is to create a password generator that is randomized due to several choices prompted to the user.

- The motivation for this project was to test our Javascript skills using prompts and confirms along with several other forms of fundamental functions. 
- I built this project as a basepoint for future Javascript practice.
- This problem solves learning how to create functions that create random strings and patterns.
- I learned how to use variables to define different sources of code and how to apply them to websites.

## Usage

This projects usage is to demonstrate different ways to randomize a password.
